- 👋 Hi, I’m @rstrandwitz
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much anything! But if I had to choose then I'd have to say emulators, design and customization, and one day (hopefully) rooting my device and creating my own ROM but I have a long way to go😜
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my way around on github and making the transfer from iPhone to android 😆 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! As limited as my colab buddy is patient with my lack of knowledge😊
- 📫 How to reach me feel free to email me at rstrandwitz@hotmail.com
